# st (Rishabh's build of Simple Terminal)

This is 0.8.4 build of st with important patches. 
This is very minimal buid with only those patches that I really need.
It may or may not be beautiful. **If you are looking for more attractive build,
then switch to alpha branch.**

## Patches

- Scrollback (scroll without holding key)

- vim-browse (Keyboard select)

- external-pipe (URL and output)

- font2 (multiple fonts for emoji)

- vertcenter (vim text aligns well)

- clipboard (copy text to browser without surprises)

- anysize (for having size similar to other windows)

## Keyboard shortcuts

- <A-k> <A-j> <A-u> <A-d> for vim like scrolling.

- <C-A-u> <C-A-y> for URL open and copy.

- <C-A-o> command output copy.

- <C-A-k> <C-A-j> to zoom in and out.

- <A-s> for vim selection mode.
